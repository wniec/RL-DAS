# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Algorithm Selection: A Proof-of-Principle Study on Differential Evolution

This is the python implementation of our paper ["Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Algorithm Selection: A Proof-of-Principle Study on Differential Evolution"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10496708), which is accepted on *IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics: Systems*. It is also integrated in our [MetaBox](https://github.com/GMC-DRL/MetaBox/tree/main).

## Installations

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GMC-DRL/RL-DAS.git
```

## Requirements
* Platform preferences: Linux (for better parallelism).

The dependencies of this project are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using the following command.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```
python Testing.py
```

The tensorboard log will be stored in log/ (need manual creation) with a file name contains the used agent and runtime (e.g. **PPO-YYYYMMDDTHHmmSS**)

The saved models are in /save_policy_PPO or /save_policy_DQN with runtime file name (e.g. **YYYYMMDDTHHmmSS**). 

For more adjustable configurations, please refer to [Parameter setting](/#Parameter-setting).
